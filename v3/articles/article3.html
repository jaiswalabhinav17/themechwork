    <h3>An Engineering Education Should Never End</h3>

            You might have received your degree years ago, but every engineer knows that his or her education never
            really ends. In fact, professional development hours credits are a requirement in many states.

            Beyond those requirements, engineers at all stages of their career can gain additional advantages and
            improve their skills through continuing education classes. Sometimes, however, it’s difficult to decide
            which courses to take.
            “To me, it often starts with business skills,” says Edward Brunet, Jr., who received his mechanical
            engineering degree from the University of New Orleans and is the founder of PDHengineer.com, which offers
            continuing education courses for engineers. Looking back on his own career, Brunet says a course on project
            management at the earlier part of mid-career would have been among the most beneficial. “Many engineers can
            design, but they could use help organizing,” he says.

        Brunet points out that many engineers find themselves in a managerial role as they enter mid-career. “It may
        not be why you went into engineering, but you can’t always avoid it,” he says.

        It also makes sense to consider the size of your company is when choosing a continuing education course. While
        you may have a sizable legal department in a huge company, in a small one, it’s a different story.

        “Here’s where taking courses on legal issues in engineering or one that just focuses on contracts can come in
        handy,” says Brunet, who was a senior mechanical engineer for Waldemar S. Nelson and Company, with a focus on
        oil industry issues. “It doesn’t mean a lawyer won’t be consulted, but you could limit the amount of time they
        have to be used.”
        Another advantage of continuing education is that it may help engineers learn new technologies and skills that
        younger employees bring to the table. Mid- or late-career engineers might feel more comfortable learning those
        in a continuing education class than requesting the training at work.

        <i class="spacetext">“You may think you know everything, but there are always new things to learn,” he says. “It doesn’t have to
            be about a requirement—it can just be about becoming the engineer you want to be, the one you know you
            really canbe.”</i>
