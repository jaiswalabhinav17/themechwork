            <p>Freshers are the individuals whose job requirements are probably the most sensitive and equally consequential. And in that, resume has a big role to play.
Freshers have always found it difficult, to crack the puzzle of job search starting with making a resume all the way to job interviews. Understandably, these undertakings are of utmost importance to everyone and make even the best-of-their-class nervous. The lack of professional exposure just adds to the disadvantage. But the catch here is, just apply a bit of thought and logic. That is all that is needed.
Starting with resume for freshers, your resume is supposed to tell how and using what you'll do the job. If you present your prowess at using your skills in the right and relevant manner, the game is won.</p>
An effectively written resume for freshers will have the following properties: 
<ul>
•	Select a simple and clean resume format with little to no graphical parts. Because what looks professional is looked at as a professional.
•	A clear and straight objective statement works best. It can have a little personal touch, ambition, etc but keep it practical. Because the title and the cover are what sell the book mostly.
•	Keep all other sentences objective and to-the-point. Write only as much is needed and no more. Because less content is easy to remember and recall.
•	It is best to avoid irrelevant interests and hobbies unless some awards or something presentable is available to present.
•	Extra emphasis should be given to any kind of work experience like internships, industrial training, academic projects, volunteering etc. Any kind of organizational and teamwork is relevant to this.
•	A single page resume is considered best for freshers. 
</ul>
And lastly, get someone to review it for you and review your resume yourself too. Make amendments but stay on course and submit on time. It doesn't have to be perfect, it just needs to get you through to the interview.
