    <h3>5 Steps You Should Take to Become a Great Mechanical Engineer  </h3>
    You probably already have an idea about what studying Mechanical Engineering implies, but what about what it takes to secure an awesome job in your field?

If your answer is the typical ‘be solution-oriented, creative, and have at least a passing knowledge of Math and Technology’ you’re only at the mountain base. There’s still some hiking to do to reach the peak. 

We’re here to fill in the blanks and cover the things that truly make Mechanical Engineers stand out on the job market. 

1. You have a higher chance to make a name for yourself if you choose a good international Engineering school

We live in a world where names sell. This can’t come as a surprise to you, but it does mean you have to be extra careful about what you put in your CV and how you can impress your higher-ups, even before they get to see your great mechanical skills at work.

If you really want to stand out from the crowd, you should orient your Bachelor’s or Master’s studies towards prestigious Engineering schools. 

Some of the most renowned and top ranked engineering schools in the world include MIT, UC Berkeley, Imperial College London, University of Tokyo, Tsinghua University, ETH Zurich, UT Delft or RWTH Aachen, among others.

But many other international universities offer good-quality Mechanical Engineering studies worthy of bragging about in your CV. If you’re looking for Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering, some top picks you can make are:
	Queen's University Belfast, in the United Kingdom;
	University of South Florida, in the United States;
	Group T - International University College Leuven, in Belgium;
	Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), in Germany;
	Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, in Italy;
	Kaunas University of Technology, in Lithuania.
2. Make sure you choose the right country for Mechanical Engineering studies
Whoever you are and whatever you choose to do, your forming years are important. This applies to you too, aspiring mechanical engineer! The more cultures and people you get to know, the more you learn about different ways to find solutions to problems. And isn’t this what all engineers do?

And here’s a secret.The countries where most Mechanical Engineering degrees are available are also likely to need most Mechanical Engineers. Here’s how the offer for Bachelors’ in Mechanical Engineering looks like:
	Mechanical Engineering in the United States;
	Mechanical Engineering in the United Kingdom;
	Mechanical Engineering in Canada;
	Mechanical Engineering in Germany;
And, if you want to be certain what’s the best destination for you, you should know that the median salary for a mechanical engineer is:
	68.000 USD/year in the U.S.;
	67.500 USD/year in the U.K.;
	12.000 USD/year in India;
	30.000 USD/year in Singapore.
3. Gaining experience as a mechanical engineer is crucial
Yes, universities matter. Yes, choosing a country which needs mechanical engineers matter. But you know what’s something that employers value even more? Experience. Hardcore, getting-hands-dirty experience.

As long as you go out there and start developing your Mechanical Engineering skills by doing internships, taking part-time jobs, volunteering, or shadowing professionals, you have the best chance of not only graduating with a great diploma, but also with practical insight about how to get the job done.

Consider this as an investment, seeing how you offer your time now, so you could exchange it later for money, power, and world domination. (Just joking)

4. Aspire to the success stories of other Mechanical Engineers, avoid making the same mistakes

Quick: what do Nikola Tesla, Rudolf Diesel, Karl Benz, and Henry Ford have in common? No, they’re not all “car parts”, but they are Mechanical Engineering graduates! They are some of those who managed to stay on top of their field and bring new and fresh ideas to the table.
The point is this: you need to know about the big names in your field and follow their methods, to avoid making rookie mistakes and get inspired when you’re stuck or everything seems overwhelming.
5. Know your industry! Careers and salaries awaiting a Mechanical Engineering graduate
Mechanical Engineering is insanely profitable and jobs being created on a daily basis, as demand for mechanical engineers rises, you can bet this is one of the best and sought-after degrees out there.
But if you really want to be great, then you should go for industries that really support your growth as a Mechanical Engineer: manufacturing, transmission equipment, architectural, and metalwork. After that, orient yourself towards top careers you can pick from, including

Materials engineer;
Consultant or researcher in a manufacturing company;
Patent law responsible.

Mission accomplished! You are now equipped with the key guidelines to go rock the world of Mechanical Engineering!
